### Hi there 👋
- 👀 I'm interested in {machine learning ∩ statistics ∩ optimization} and its applications in deep learning contexts. 
- 📖 My research highlights include foundations and methods for reinforcement learning in practical settings including robust Bayesian quadrature optimization, distributional reinforcement learning and offline reinforcement learning. 
- 🔭 Besides offline RL, recently, I've working on out-of-distribution generalization. 
- 👯 I’m actively open to research collaborations. Please feel free to drop me an email at `nguyent2792 AT gmail DOT com` if you are interested in collaborating with me.
