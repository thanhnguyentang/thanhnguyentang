### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in {machine learning âˆ© statistics âˆ© optimization} and its applications in deep learning contexts. 
- ðŸ“– My research highlights include foundations and methods for reinforcement learning in practical settings including robust Bayesian quadrature optimization, distributional reinforcement learning and offline reinforcement learning. 
- ðŸ”­ Besides offline RL, recently, I've working on out-of-distribution generalization. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to research collaborations.
